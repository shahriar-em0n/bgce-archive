🧩 Tech Stack (Future Web App Vision)
This vault is powered by several modern tools and practices for collaboration, code sharing, and documentation. Feel free to explore more about our tech stack:

If this turns into a community-driven web interface:

```bash
• Frontend: React / Svelte / Next.js / Vue
• Backend: Go
• Storage: GitHub + SQLite/Postgres
• Auth: GitHub OAuth (optional)
• Deployment: AWS
```

UI/UX ideas for the future web App

```bash
Most preferable one for now:
1. Modern Library-Style UI
   - Homepage: A clean, minimalist grid of featured archives with a search bar in the center.
   - Filters & Categories: Sidebar with quick access to categories (by year, author, tags, etc.).
   - Reading Mode: Dark/light mode toggle, distraction-free fullscreen mode.
   - Bookmarking & Notes: Users can highlight text and add personal notes to archives.
```

Other types of UI

```bash
2. Timeline-Based UI
3. Grid & Gallery UI
4. Terminal-Inspired UI
5. Tag-Based UI
6. Map-Based UI
7. AI-Assisted UI
8. Infinite Scroll vs. Pagination Debate
```
