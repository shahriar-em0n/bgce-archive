🧩 Tech Stack (Future Web App Vision)

If this turns into a community-driven web interface:

```bash
• Frontend: React / Svelte / Next.js / Vue
• Backend: Go
• Storage: GitHub + SQLite/Postgres
• Auth: GitHub OAuth (optional)
• Deployment: AWS
```
UI/UX ideas for the future web App
```bash
Most preferable one for now:
1. Modern Library-Style UI
   - Homepage: A clean, minimalist grid of featured archives with a search bar in the center.
   - Filters & Categories: Sidebar with quick access to categories (by year, author, tags, etc.).
   - Reading Mode: Dark/light mode toggle, distraction-free fullscreen mode.
   - Bookmarking & Notes: Users can highlight text and add personal notes to archives.
```
Other types of UI
```bash
2. Timeline-Based UI
3. Grid & Gallery UI
4. Terminal-Inspired UI
5. Tag-Based UI
6. Map-Based UI
7. AI-Assisted UI
8. Infinite Scroll vs. Pagination Debate
```
